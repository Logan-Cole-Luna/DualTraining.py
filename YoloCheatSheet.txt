Training Values:
box_loss: The loss related to bounding box predictions.
It measures how well the model is doing at predicting the location and size of the boxes around the objects.

This indicates how well the model is at classifying the objects within the boxes.

Instances: The number of object instances in the images that were processed during this epoch.

Size: The input size of images during training, which is 640 pixels. This can vary as YOLO supports multi-scale training.

R: Recall for the objects detected.

mAP50: Mean Average Precision at IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold of 0.5.
It's a common metric for object detection, representing model accuracy.
